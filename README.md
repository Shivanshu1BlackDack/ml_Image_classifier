Food Classifier using Deep Learning
This project is a machine learning-based web app that classifies food images into categories like Bread, Meat, Dessert, and more.
Built with TensorFlow and Streamlit, it allows users to upload or capture images, processes them with a trained CNN model, and outputs the top three predicted food classes with confidence scores.
